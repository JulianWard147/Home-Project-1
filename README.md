# Home-Project-1

### BLUF: This is 60% practice, 30% for would be employers to look at, 10% informative, mostly just so I have to explain what I'm doing and why, which is a KEY skill in the real world

This project is starting because I didn't do as well as I wanted on a technical challenge and I'm looking to get some more practice in Python to keep myself sharp. Basically, I've been so up in the theory of data science and ML and all that that I ate it on the coding questions and I realize it's because I hadn't been keeping my basic skills sharp and I'd stopped pushing myself in that aspect of my resume. 

I do want to bring in some more capital D Data later, but for now that's not the focus. I am going to start with a 'data' prompt, but I'm not actually going to be doing much with Data at first, aside from glance off certain topics and themes.

### The Prompt:

There's this meme/infographic that pops up every once in a while. It's probably apocryphal, but it's a nice illustration of 'survivorship bias'.

![Survivorship-bias svg](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/85522002/163843571-cbbae519-afdd-4758-95f4-cd7008cd7cd5.png)

The story goes something along the lines that some airforce, was trying to use data to figure out where to armor their bombers, so they sent two data nerds to go and examine the returning bombers to see where they needed to add extra armor. There's a trade off for weight and resource costs, so  the airforce can't just armor everything. Goofus looks at the bombers coming back and wants to put armor where all the bullet holes are. This is because, clearly, this is where the planes are being shot more. Gallant looks at the same bombers, and wants to armor the places where there AREN'T bullet holes, seeing clearly that that indicates that a bomber which takes damage to a component in those places is a bomber that doesn't return. I love this story. I have no idea how true it is, but it's a great concrete way to describe Survivorship bias in specific and sampling biases in general. 

### The Plan:

I want to explore this problem with Python, not theory. I spent too much time building a Monte Hall Problem simulator in my bootcamp, well past the point where I needed to. It was great practice though. So this project is me getting back to that balance of having an overall goal while still learning and exploring in a less structured way. I'm going to give myself subgoals as I go along, basically until I lose interest or get busy with other tasks. Stage one is going to be building a 'plane'. Next I need to shoot at it. Then I need to add armor, and probably think about how to analyze my 'returning' planes.

### Stage 1:

I imagine the repo will be organized something like:

-Folder 1: First stage of the project
--Notebooks
-Folder 2: Second stage of the project
--Notebooks
-Folder n: nth stage of the project
--Notebooks
-Roadmap.txt: A rough outline of the different stages, focused on forthcoming steps
-Reflections.txt: Less formal musings on lessons learned
